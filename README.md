# Cutting Board Generator

A small Ruby script that generates end-grain cutting board patterns.

Use this as a "starter" repo. Tweak the wood images and the algorithm to make your own designs.

# Usage

Generate the cutting board image:

    ./cutting_board_generator.rb


Generate the cutting board image and open the image: (On Mac, it opens Preview.)

    ./generate.sh

# Example

This is a design for a 18" x 12" cutting board. (If each piece of wood is 1" x 2".)
